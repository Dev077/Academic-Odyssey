# Academic-Odyssey

The story line follows the main character of the game, who is an advocate for student
safety and overall well-being. As he notices some of the Engineering students at Western
University are not taking care of themselves and following unhealthy study habits, he sets out on
a quest to take down any Zombies and aims to find the source of this bad energy. As he
progresses through his journey, he realizes that an upcoming difficult assignment may be the
cause for the unrest, however, he also notices some strange activity throughout the Engineering
building which he is eager to check out. As you traverse through each level, you will be
confronted with Zombies (students infected with some sort of virus) of varying strengths, and
each level will test your ability to problem solve and use rational thinking. At the end of each
level, you will be met by a boss battle which is sure to test your skills to the max!
Level 1 begins with the character entering ACEB (Amit Chakma Engineering Building) and
defeating several random Zombies before meeting the first boss challenge which is a trivia
challenge. After completing this, the boss master directs the character to the next challenge,
Teja’s Task, located in the UES lounge to obtain the USB that contains the solution to the
assignment that all the students are struggling with. Afterwards the character takes the elevator to
the second floor where they are met with higher level zombies that require more clicks to defeat.
Eventually they face the second-floor boss master in a series of memory questions. Once that is
complete, the character makes their way to the elevator to get to the 3rd floor only to realize that
the elevator is broken, and a student inside tells them they must take the stairs and pass “Obaid's
stair challenge” to reach the next level. Once the 3rd floor is reached, The character then faces the
last boss master on level three “Zain’s Mad House” who has a series of riddles and obstacles that
the character must solve to escape his room. In this level, the Joker and the Riddler have taken
over, and killed all the zombies for you, but their riddles are tricky, and the combination lock is
not easy to open! After completing this challenge, the player can go to face the final boss of the
game, Dr Shaima Ali, who is trying to stop you from uploading the assignment and save the
students. The task is to keep the USB safe while she sends zombies of varying difficulty at you,
asks trivia questions, and tests your memory. If the player can pass each stage, the game ends and
the students are saved, but if they fail, they must start over!
Rules:
• Reach to the end of each floor without taking too much damage.
• Defeat x amount of zombies and collect coins before reaching floor boss master
• Defeat each floor master to progress to the next level and eventually reach the top
floor
• Complete challenges along the way to reach the next floor

Mock-ups:
The game is modelled after the ACEB (Amit Chakma Engineering Building) with each floor of
the game reflecting a floor of ACEB. Will be 3D from a 3rd person perspective following the
character as they traverse ACEB. In general, the main character stays within the hallways, but
there are occasions where they may enter certain rooms (such as professor’s offices or the UES
Lounge). The final boss level is a large room with a computer in it, this computer spawns
Professor Shaima Ali. The first and second floor of ACEB look normal, however the 3rd floor
reflects Zain’s true madness, as it has imagery of the Joker all over the place, and an unsettling
soundtrack.
The sequence diagram and the uml class diagram remain the same! There were no changes
major enough for there to be any updates to them!
